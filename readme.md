Hello :)

This is some cool slider, with changing picture of my cat Ruby :)

I am still learning JavaScript, this mini-project I found on Traversy Media YouTube channel, and it was interesting to me, so I did it on my own

Also, it is done with SASS, it is fun way to do CSS

Any advice is wellcome :)
